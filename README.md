For resize_niftis.m to work, the following function (resize_img.m) must be added to your MATLAB path: http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/G.Ridgway/vbm/resize_img.m

Relevant parameters (e.g. beta weights, training set intercept, training set slope, and training set voxelwise data - for z-scoring) are available for request from Zenodo through the following link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2819646
