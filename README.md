# brainPAD
Predict brain age and calculate brain-predicted age difference scores from T1 MRIs

The following must be added to your MATLAB path for this code to work:

    1) SPM
    2) The function resize_img.m (can be obtained here http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/G.Ridgway/vbm/resize_img.m)

Relevant parameters (e.g. beta weights, training set intercept, training set slope, and training set voxelwise data - for z-scoring) are available for request from Zenodo through the following link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2819646
